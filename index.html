                <h1>About Me!</h1>
                <strong><small>I was born in Washington, DC, but I am a proud rep for PG County, Maryland since I've lived there for most of my life.</small></strong>
                    <p>My family is from Vietnam, so fortunately enough for me, I am bilingual. I have only one sister who is 4 years
                    younger than me and she's studying to be a sonographer! My family has always wanted me to be in the medical field but,
                    I feel like I'm too much of a free spirit to have such a routine career where there's not much room for flexebility in
                    terms of day-to-day life. I'm more of a trade and skills person. I like to work with my hands and I like work that gives
                    me a different result than what I started with. I am a crafter. Being born in the 90's, I was able to get a front row seat
                    to the fast-changing world of technology so when I was put in the IT program in high school, it changed my life. I knew this
                    was a very good opportunity for me to learn as much as I can without having to pay for outside classes. Upon finishing the program,
                    I am extremely confident in my computer system troubleshooting, support, and administration skills. I still use these skills everyday.

                    <p>I've been a full-time dog groomer for the past 4 years. I love working on and playing with dogs! In 2016, I was looking
                    for a part time retail job to hold while I went to community college since I was in the "finding myself" stage. Well, I got the job
                    and 5 months and about 3 majors later, I decided to take a break from school and just learn to do something I never thought I'd 
                    be doing. My manager told me she thought I'd be a great groomer so if I'd like, I could stop working as a floor associate and go to 
                    grooming school, all paid for by the company. I started my training period, went to grooming school, and passed my technical breed tests
                    within 3-4 months. That's when the fun began. I was able to work on so many more different breeds and do all kinds of different cuts.
                    I've worked with dogs with all kinds of temperaments (good and bad) but my job was always so fun and no days were the same. Sadly, a couple
                    days before Thanksgiving 2021, we all found out the place we had worked at for so many years was closing for good and our last day
                    was Christmas Eve. Some good did come out of it though, I now have my own grooming business and I feel so lucky to still be employed during
                    this pandemic. I am ready to learn something new.

                <h1>New Venture</h1>
                <strong><small>I decided I want to step back into the world of tech.</small></strong>
                    <p>With the IT program I was in while in high school, I spent a lot of time working on computer systems and telecommunications. 
                        We mainly worked on network, OS, and device configuration. They did offer a Computer Science and Data class where they 
                        taught programming but, I never got the chance to enroll even though I've always wanted to learn to code. Tumblr webpage tweaking
                        was the closest I've ever come to coding. By the end of high school, I had obtained a few IT certifications (CompTIA+, MTA, and CCENT).
                        I never took the liberty to put any of them to good use but I've always been more into programming. I want to become a coder since
                        it <i>is</i> a universal language and there are many opportunities everywhere. I would love to express and show my creativity 
                        to the world through the Internet.
